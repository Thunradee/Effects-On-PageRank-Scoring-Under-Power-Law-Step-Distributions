# Effects On PageRank Scoring Under Power Law Step Distributions
In this work, we aim to study the effect of altering the step distribution implicit in the Personalized PageRank algorithm. After modifying the step distribution within Personalized PageRank to follow Zipf’s Law, we test assumptions of convergence to a stationary distribution. Furthermore, we design two distinct measures to analyze the differences between the modified algorithm’s scoring in comparison the classical algorithm.
